The Project,
A plan to Revolutionize the way people become employed. This means changing the way job seekers find a job, while also changing the way companies find employees.  Create an online platform where individuals can communicate with employers, with more then just a general application.  Allow companies to see a detailed profile of potential employees, and allow them to reach out and offer jobs.  This site will allow a user to have a professional profile which will get them interviewed (virtually or in pearson) and then get hired.   

Make it so simple and quick to both get employeed and find employees.
